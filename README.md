# mBot-Maze-Race-Project

## Introduction
This is a robotic project whereby the mBot needs to find its way through a maze in the shortest time. The mBot will be facing a number of challenges at intermediate waypoints while attempting to complete the race. The mBot must not bump into any wall by relying on a front ultrasonic sensor, and two side IR proximity sensors to accomplish this. Additionally, the mBot will have to sense colours and detect different frequency of tones.
